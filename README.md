The election commission has requested some additional data to complete an audit after the submission of the election results. They required the following additional items:
-	The voter turnout for each county 
-	The percentage of votes for each county out of the total count 
-	The county with the highest turnout 

The purpose of this challenge was to audit an election by utilizing loops and repetitive statements to retrieve the above data specifics request to complete the election audit.  

## Methodology
Loops, conditional statements, and decision statements were utilized to provide the required additional data. The loop command repeats the code created over and over in the data pool to provide the results; this was iterated over dictionary to get certain values. Additionally, conditional statements and logical operators were used to extract the required elements namely; percentage of votes for each candidate, votes per county, the winner candidate votes  which may be utilized for analysis to provide a more in-depth review of the election results.

The script utilized to provide the election results was very easy to read, versatile, manageable and flexible. As such this script may be utilized for other elections by simply changing the variables and commands for the respective electorate data. Here are some examples of how the script could be modified and used to extract data for:
1. The amount of votes for each candidate in each county to make a comparision between candidates for different elections.
2. Automate additional commands to retrieve data about the voter - ie  demographics, age, sex, race etc.
